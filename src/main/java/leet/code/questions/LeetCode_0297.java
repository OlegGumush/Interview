//        297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
//        Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored
//        in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or
//        another computer environment.
//
//        Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
//        There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
//        You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized
//        to the original tree structure.
//
//        Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily
//        need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
